# *R for Data Science*
Workshops co-organized by the Library, Department of Mathematical Sciences, and Statistical Consulting & Research Services

## *Introduction to R and RStudio*  

This workshop will start with the building blocks of creating and exploring the data structures available in R. Then we'll learn some basic tools for inspecting, extracting, manipulating, summarizing, and visualizing data. We will also discuss accessing and using R packages, and how to use R's built-in help interface. The workshop will be presented in the RStudio Cloud.


## *Intermediate R*  

Extend your knowledge of R with relational and logical operators, conditional statements, loops, and functions. These concepts will be first presented conceptually, with computational practice afterward. The workshop will be presented in the RStudio Cloud.

## *Data Wrangling in R*

In this workshop, you will learn how to manipulate data in R using the dplyr and tidyr packages. These concepts will be presented in an interactive format, integrating computational practice throughout the workshop. The workshop will be presented in the RStudio Cloud.

## *Data Visualization in R*

The ability to create meaningful and attractive data visualizations is an essential skill of data-intensive research. This workshop will give you an overview of the grammar of graphics plotting concepts from the ggplot2 package. These concepts will be presented in an interactive format, integrating computational practice throughout the workshop. The workshop will be presented in the RStudio Cloud.
