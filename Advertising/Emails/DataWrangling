Hello all, 

This is a reminder that you signed-up for the Data Wrangling in R workshop today
from 2:30-5:00. The workshop will be held in the Heathcote Classroom in the 
basement of the Library (by the bathrooms). 

The workshop will cover how to use the dplyr and tidyr packages for data 
wrangling tasks. In dplyr we will cover topics of selecting columns, filtering 
rows, creating and/or modifying columns, and how to create a linear process out 
of the data wrangling steps. Then, we will go over how we can use dplyr to join
different datasets together. Using tidyr we will reshape a data frame from 
long to wide format and back. 

The materials for the workshop are available through the RStudio Cloud at the 
Data Wrangling workspace (http://bit.ly/data-wrangle). If you have not accessed 
the RStudio Cloud before, you will need to create a log-in or use your GitHub 
or Google log-in. Then you will need to direct to the workspace (using the 
above link) and click on the blue "Join Workspace" button. Once you are inside,
the workshop materials are available through the Projects tab.

We would encourage you to bring a dataset you are working with to the workshop.
Then, if time permits, you can use the tools from the workshop to wrangle your 
data into a tidy format, suitable for visualization or analyses! 

Looking forward to seeing everyone!
