Hello everyone,  
 
This is an email to remind you that you are signed up for the Introduction to R
(for data analytics) workshop tomorrow from 2:30 to 5pm in the Heathcote 
classroom at the Library. The Heathcote classroom is located in the basement of
the Library, by the restrooms. We will try to have signs directing you there! 
If, for any reason, you will not be able to attend the workshop, please let me
know, as there is a waitlist to get into the workshop. 


The workshop will cover the basics of working with different classes of objects,
loading data into R, inspecting, extracting, manipulating, summarizing, and 
visualizing data.  The workshop materials can be accessed here: 
http://bit.ly/introduction-R, but you will need to create a login or use your 
Google sign-in. Note: RStudio Cloud interacts best with Google Chrome (other 
browsers have trouble updating the content).  Once you've logged in:

1. navigate to the Intro to R workspace, by clicking on the link above
2. you will be taken to a page asking if you would like to join the space
3. click the blue "Join Space" button to join the workspace
4. click on the "Projects" tab 
5. click on the Introduction to R project 

Now, you're all set for the workshop!
