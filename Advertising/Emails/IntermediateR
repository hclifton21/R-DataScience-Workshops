Hello everyone,  
 
This is an email to remind you that you are signed up for the Intermediate R 
workshop tomorrow (Thursday) from 2:30 to 5pm in the ILS room at the Library. 
The workshop will cover relational and conditional statements, looping, and 
user-defined functions. The workshop will be presented in the RStudio Cloud, an
interface for collaborating with RStudio. 

 
The workshop materials can be accessed here: https://rstudio.cloud/project/46127, 
but you will need to create a login or use your Google sign-in. Note: RStudio 
Cloud interacts best with Google Chrome (other browsers have trouble updating 
the content).

forward to seeing everyone tomorrow!
