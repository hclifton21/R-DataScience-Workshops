Hello everyone,  
 
This is a reminder that you signed-up for the Data Visualization in R workshop 
today from <INSERT TIME HERE>. The workshop will be held in the <INSERT LOCATION 
HERE, WITH DIRECTIONS>. Registration for the workshop is full and there are 
quite a few individuals on the waitlist, so please respond if registered but 
will not be attending! We do ask that, if you are on the waitlist, you please 
wait outside the classroom, until we know that all of the registrants have 
arrived. 

For those of you on the waitlist, we will be broadcasting the workshop via 
WebEx. You are welcome to log-in to WebEx and watch the video from the basement 
of the library. That way, if you have questions, you can type a message and a 
workshop helper can scamper out to talk with you.

The workshop will cover relational and conditional statements, looping, and 
user-defined functions. 

The materials for the workshop are available through the RStudio Cloud at the 
Intermediate R workspace (http://bit.ly/intermediate-R). If you have not 
accessed the RStudio Cloud before, you will need to create a log-in or use your 
GitHub or Google log-in. Then you will need to direct to the workspace (using 
the above link) and click on the blue "Join Workspace" button. Once you are 
inside, the workshop materials are available through the Projects tab. 

To keep these workshops funded for the foreseeable future, we request that you 
take a few minutes to fill out this pre-workshop survey. For question 3, the 
Intermediate R workshop you are attending is a component of the Software  
Carpentry, R for Reproducible Research workshop.
