Hi Talisha, 

I'm sorry about the website, I was told that the workshops would be up there this week. 
Here is more information about them! 

We give a series of four 3-hour workshops every semester that teach a hybrid of topics from Software 
Carpentry's R for Reproducible Scientific analysis (functions, loops, conditionals) and Data Carpentry's 
Data Analysis and Visualization from the Ecology curriculum. All of the workshops are given at Montana State
University in the Heathcote classroom in the Library. The workshops are broken down as follows:

- Intro to R -- January 23, 2020 from 3:15-5:45pm (MST)
- Data Visualization with ggplot2 -- February 20, 2020 from 3:15-5:45 (MST)
- Intermediate R -- March 12, 2020 from 3:15-5:45 (MST)
- Data Wrangling with dplyr & tidyr -- April 2, 2020 from 3:15-5:45 (MST)

(insert name here) is the lead instructor of every workshop, and Sara Mannheimer, 
(insert names here) are the workshop helpers. 

Let me know if there is any additional information you need! 

Allison
