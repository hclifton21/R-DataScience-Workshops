Hi all, 

This is a reminder that you signed-up for the Data Visualization in R workshop 
today from 2:30-5:00. The workshop will be held in the Heathcote Classroom in 
the basement of the Library (by the basement bathrooms). 

The workshop will cover how to use the ggplotpackage to easily create a variety 
of different data visualizations. We will cover how to create visualizations for
one and two variables, and how to incorporate further variables using additional
plotting aesthetics. Finally, we will discuss how to make customizations for 
your plots, arrange multiple plots on a page, and export plots for future 
publications. 

The materials for the workshop are available through the RStudio Cloud at the 
Data Wrangling workspace (http://bit.ly/data-vizz). If you have not accessed the
RStudio Cloud before, you will need to create a log-in or use your GitHub or 
Google log-in. Then you will need to direct to the workspace (using the above 
link) and click on the blue "Join Workspace" button. Once you are inside, the 
workshop materials are available through the Projects tab.
