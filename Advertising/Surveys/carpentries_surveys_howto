Step 1: Complete this form to alert the Carpentries you are doing a 
self-organized workshop! 

https://amy.carpentries.org/forms/self-organised/

Step 2: Create a workshop webpage, so you can access the surveys. Every workshop
needs to have a webpage, which follows their website template:

https://github.com/carpentries/workshop-template

The GitHub tutorial for what you need to edit for the workshop page is great and
easy to follow!

Step 3: Email the workshop website address to the Carpentries assessment 
person you are corresponding with (whoever responded to your self-organized 
workshop submission).
